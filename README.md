Dodger is an open source HTML5 canvas game.
I'm hosting this on my website:

## How To Play

Avoid the falling red and gray blocks. Use the arrow keys or WASD to navigate your player. You can hold Enter or Shift to use Nitro. Nitro regenerates automatically and can be use to slowdown time.

The green blocks(gems) will refill your Nitro.

## Waves

Each wave consist of a randomly generated amount of blocks. With each wave, you'll find more and faster falling blocks. You'll also regenerate your Nitro faster aswell.
